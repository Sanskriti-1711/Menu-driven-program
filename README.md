# Menu-driven-program

This menu driven program consist of automated commands that will help you run the following software with ease:

Ø Apache Hadoop

Ø AWS(Amazon Web Services)

Ø LVM(Logical Volume Manager)

Ø Docker



All you need to do is choose from the options given!



1. Apache Hadoop:

Apache Hadoop is a collection of open-source software utilities that facilitates using a network of many computers to solve problems involving massive amounts of data and computation. It provides a software framework for distributed storage and processing of big data using the MapReduce programming model.



This program can do the following in Hadoop:

Start the namenode, Start the datanode , Stop the namenode, Stop the datanode, Format the namenode, Show cluster report, Run tcpdump, Make a directory, Create an empty directory, Upload a file, Read a file, Stop firewall, To check used & unused ports, etc.



2. AWS(Amazon Web Services):

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a subsidiary of Amazon providing on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. These cloud computing web services provide a variety of basic abstract technical infrastructure and distributed computing building blocks and tools. One of these services is Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), which allows users to have at their disposal a virtual cluster of computers, available all the time, through the Internet.



In this menu driven program we also have embedded the audio function for ease. You just need to install pyaudio library in linux using cmd:

pip install pyaudio


This program will let you launch instances, create keys, stop instances, create security group, create EBS volume, Attach/Detach/Delete EBS volume, Upload data in S3, Create Cloud Front Distribution, Create Snapshot, etc. 



3. LVM (Logical Volume Manager):

Creating and deleting partitions in Linux is a regular practice because storage devices (such as hard drives and USB drives) must be structured in some way before they can be used. In most cases, large storage devices are divided into separate sections called partitions. Partitioning also allows you to divide your hard drive into isolated sections, where each section behaves as its own hard drive.

Steps for partitioning a disk-

1. List the partitions using the parted -l command to identify the storage device you want to partition.

2. Open the storage device.

3. Set the partition table type to gpt, then enter Yes to accept it.

4. Review the partition table of the storage device.

5. Create a new partition using the mkpart command.

6. Quit using the quit command.



Logical Volume Manager (LVM) is a device mapper framework that provides logical volume management for the Linux kernel. Most modern Linux distributions are LVM-aware to the point of being able to have their root file systems on a logical volume. LVM can be considered as a thin software layer on top of the hard disks and partitions, which creates an abstraction of continuity and ease-of-use for managing hard drive replacement, repartitioning and backup.

In this program you can use LVM for the following:

 Create a logical volume(dynamic partition)
 Increase the size of partition(logical volume)
 Increase the size of volume group


4. Docker:

Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. All containers are run by a single operating system kernel and therefore use fewer resources than virtual machines.



In this Menu-driven program Docker can be used for starting docker service, downloading docker images, running docker container, deleting os, deleting images and much more.
